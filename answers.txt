Your answers go here!

Also start by noting if You have a teammate and if I should check this git repository or Your teammates for the grading of code.

Overall
Everything works all methods of allocation are functional if there are any questions
please ask we will make clerifications with coments or just discuss the code.
COuldn't add better coments because it is 2:00 am

Note 
we did not need to implement the protection against overflow of allocated memory so if you write then you allocated you will write to the next block 
this will not break the allocation program but you will write in free available memory therefore the info there can be overwriten.


Task3
Description of algorithms
description of buffer and block allocation is in Questionere

Best fit goes through all book keeping structs and keeps track of the array number for the best fit block
best fir
     block is found by compearing in loop of structs the last best fit to the distance of current struct required memory allocation 
 -> current struct.size - allocatbale (before check if that size fits (struct.size >= allocatable) )
 so we loop through all structs and keep only the best fit than we return its pointer and reserve the memory

Worst fit
     very similar to best fit goes through all the structs but only keeps the struct with the biggest size everything else the same as best fit.

First fit
    Kristers 
Next fit

Last fit

mesurments

for mode: 4 worst fit on chunks2 and sizes2
real    0m0,001s
user    0m0,001s
sys     0m0,000s


for mode: 3 
real    0m0,002s
user    0m0,000s
sys     0m0,001s

for mode: 2
real    0m0,002s
user    0m0,002s
sys     0m0,000s

for mode: 1
real    0m0,001s
user    0m0,001s
sys     0m0,000s

for mode: 0
real    0m0,001s
user    0m0,000s
sys     0m0,001s

To be honest with this small of a size I don't think I can judge the diferences they are all quite equal and changes are due to 
my computers resources at the time of running it might be switching to something else in the process as we use system calls

Overall conclusion 
It is 2:19am it works looks to be fast enough I think I did my job.
